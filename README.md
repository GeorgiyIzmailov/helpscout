# HelpScout Create Ticket Example

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GeorgiyIzmailov/helpscout.git
```

Setup dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Get application secrets

1. Login to HelpScout (accept the invite sent to your e-mail).

2. To test the repository you need to create an app on the platform. Open your profile picture then select **Your Profile**.

3. Click on the **My Apps** tab.

4. Create application by giving it an **App Name** and setting its **Redirection URL** to `http://localhost:3000/api/helpscout-webhook`.

6. Add the copied values to the `.env` file:

In our case, the mailbox ID is `320281`.

It should also be added to the .env file:

```bash
...
REACT_APP_MAILBOX_ID="YOUR_MAILBOX_ID";
...
```
